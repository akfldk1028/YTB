🎯 MANDATORY DYNAMIC SCENE GENERATION:

- CRITICAL: Use EXACT durations from individual_scene_durations array (match index positions)
- NEVER default to 3 scenes - strictly follow dynamic configuration
- Each scene duration must match the corresponding array index
- FAILURE TO FOLLOW = REJECTED OUTPUT
