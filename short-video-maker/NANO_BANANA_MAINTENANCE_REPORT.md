# NANO BANANA Static Video Generation - Maintenance Report

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Test ID**: cmgccnj7s00062qdl2dbad0ec  
**Status**: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## Summary

Testing of the NANO BANANA static video generation pipeline revealed that while image generation works correctly, **duplicate file saving is still occurring** and **PNG files are not being saved to videoId folders**, causing video generation to fail.

## Test Results

### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS
1. **TTS Processing**: ElevenLabs quota fallback to Google TTS works perfectly
2. **Whisper Transcription**: Audio transcription completes successfully 
3. **NANO BANANA API**: Image generation API calls succeed with base64 responses
4. **Folder Creation**: VideoId-based folders are created correctly
5. **Overall Pipeline Flow**: All components execute in correct sequence

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### 1. **Duplicate File Saving Still Occurring**
- **Problem**: Both `nano-banana-timestamp.png` and `scene_X_videoId.png` files are being generated
- **Expected**: Only scene-based files should be created
- **Root Cause**: NanoBananaService is still saving files despite code changes

#### 2. **Files Not Saved to VideoId Folders**  
- **Problem**: VideoId folder `/temp/cmgccnj7s00062qdl2dbad0ec` is empty
- **Expected**: Should contain `scene_1_cmgccnj7s00062qdl2dbad0ec.png` and `scene_2_cmgccnj7s00062qdl2dbad0ec.png`
- **Impact**: Video generation fails because no PNG files found

#### 3. **Static Video Generation Failure**
- **Status**: "failed" - Video processing failed or video file not found
- **Cause**: No PNG files available for video creation

## Previous Fix Attempts

### ✅ COMPLETED FIXES
1. **Folder Preservation**: Fixed cleanup logic to preserve folders in Nano Banana mode
2. **Scene-based Naming**: Implemented scene index parameter for proper file naming
3. **Pipeline Integration**: All components properly connected

### ❌ REMAINING ISSUES
1. **NanoBananaService File Saving**: Despite removing file saving code, duplicate files still being created
2. **File Location**: Files not appearing in expected videoId-based folders

## Technical Investigation Required

### Files to Review:
1. `src/image-generation/services/NanoBananaService.ts:103-112` - File saving logic
2. `src/short-creator/nanoBananaStaticVideo.ts:64-83` - Image saving implementation
3. `src/short-creator/ShortCreator.ts` - Scene processing and image generation calls

### Key Log Evidence:
```
✅ NANO BANANA API call successful with base64 response
✅ Image generation: "filename: scene_1_cmgccnj7s00062qdl2dbad0ec.png"  
❌ File not found in expected location: /temp/cmgccnj7s00062qdl2dbad0ec/
```

## Recommended Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
1. **Debug File Saving**: Trace exact execution path of image saving in NanoBananaService
2. **Verify Integration**: Ensure nanoBananaStaticVideo properly receives and saves images
3. **Test File Paths**: Confirm tempDirPath is correctly constructed

### VERIFICATION STEPS
1. Add debug logging to track file saving operations
2. Verify all duplicate saving code has been properly removed
3. Test with simple 1-scene video to isolate the issue

## Impact Assessment

- **Functionality**: NANO BANANA static video generation completely non-functional
- **User Experience**: API returns success but video generation fails
- **Data Integrity**: VideoId folders created but remain empty

## Conclusion

The NANO BANANA pipeline **architecture is correct** but there's a **critical file saving bug** preventing static video generation. The issue is likely in the **disconnection between image generation success and actual file persistence**.

**Status**: Requires immediate technical investigation and fix.
